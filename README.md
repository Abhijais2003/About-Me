This is simple website that i made during my summer vication,
this website is simply described about me that who i am and what i am doing right now. 
I just use HTML 5 and CSS 3 for making this website becuase there is no dynamic content in my website so i don't JavaScript in this website.
I want my personal website looks so pretty and simple.

You can access my personal website on this link:-
